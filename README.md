# Secret Agent Bot And Game
I want to create a player for a game I played with my friends, that will be far better than I could ever be with my current brain power.
If you want to join just contack me, I'm new to github and don't know how to use it well.

## First, I will explain how the game works for anyone to join and help with the project.

The first four images represent the 4 possible moving options, and the fifth picture is the map. The names are in my primary language, they don't matter. You can move from one place to another if they are directly connected by a line. With the veicle of the color.
